### About

This is a small helper library to make it easier to interface between in memory Python
variables and the data specified by Ansible Runner's _Input Directory Hierarchy_.

I am building this primarily to help me with [Lampsible](https://github.com/saint-hilaire/lampsible)
and [Docksible](https://github.com/saint-hilaire/docksible), but anyone who is working with
Ansible Runner might find this useful.

This is not ready for use yet.
